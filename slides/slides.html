## What is Docker?

--

- Something people _will not_ shut the hell up about 
--
(myself included)

--

- docker.com: 
--
"Docker is the world's leading software containerization platform"

--

- _containerization_?

--

**My Take** 
--
-- Docker is a tool for _packaging software_ so it:

--

- is easy to run the same way in different places
--
.pull-right[(portable)]

--

- is easy to throw away and start over
--
.pull-right[(disposable)]

--

- runs the same way tomorrow, next month, next year
--
.pull-right[(reproducible)]

---

## We increasingly need to not just _write_ code, but _run it_ somewhere else

--

## Managing servers is a lot of work, and we want to spend as little time doing it as possible

--

## **Docker lets me be lazy and worry less about the systems running our code**

---

## If only we knew sooner...

--

Issues we could have solved with Docker:

--

- We have a shiny app on AWS we can no longer run locally

--

- We have another shiny app that takes 1-2 hours to re-deploy when things go wrong

--

- We've delivered code that took our client multiple hours to find and install non-R dependencies for

--

Packrat is ~~great~~okay at managing R package dependencies, but Docker makes it easy to handle _the other stuff_:

--

- system-level dependencies (java, curl, ssl, etc.)

--

- unpackaged R code (analysis, modeling, etc.)

--

- R version

---

## Okay, so what's a container?

--

- It's where your code goes!

--

- _Not_ a new concept; been in linux for decades 
--
(but Docker started in 2013)

--

- _Containerizing_ some code mean packing it up into a single object that has both your code and everything your code needs to run

--

- We call those objects container _images_

--

- You need special software (docker) to run images, but it should run exactly the same anywhere you run it

--

- A _container_ is an instance of an image deployed on some computer

---

## Did you just describe a virtual machine?

--
Yeah, pretty much! But:

--

- Containers are more _lightweight_ and _portable_ than VM's

--

- Containers are easier to deploy, and you can fit more on one system

--

- It's easier to tell a container what you need than to tell a VM

--

- Docker : containers :: Vagrant : virtual machines

--

- VM's emulate a computer _down to the hardware_, but containers make more assumptions, and share common pieces between them

---

---

## Why so damn popular?

--

.pull-left[
In Software Development:

- ensure consistency between dev/staging/production environments

- makes "dev-ops" easier

- many small pieces (microservices) are easier to evolve than one big piece (monolith)
]

--

.pull-right[
In Data Science:

- ensure the model runs when it's not on your computer

- would rather build models than babysit servers

- single container can have many different pieces like R, Python, Jupyter, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.
]

---

## How do we use it?

--
.pull-left[
You'll Need:

- docker installed (possibly in a VM)

- access to the terminal

- network/internet access
]

--

.pull-right[
Steps:

1. write a Dockerfile (what your code needs)

2. build an image from the Dockerfile

3. run that image somewhere
]

--

[The Rocker group](https://github.com/rocker-org) builds &amp; maintains awesome R images on [Docker Hub](hub.docker.com), including:

--

- plain R

--

- R + RStudio

--

- R + RStudio + Tidyverse

--

- R + Shiny Server

--

- R + tex and related stuff

--

Using one of these let's us skip right to step 3, running the image.

---

## Running RStudio Server in a container

--

If you have docker setup, it's one command to start running RStudio Server with all the Tidyverse pre-installed:

--

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:8787 rocker/tidyverse
```

--

This will:

--

1. Download an image, layer-by-layer, from Docker Hub to your computer

--

2. Run that image, which includes starting RStudio Server inside the image

--

3. Expose the RStudio port (8787) through the local machine's port 80

--

Now open a browser, go to `localhost` (or the IP of your VM), and login to RStudio Server with user/pass `rstudio`/`rstudio`!

--

Sure, you already have R, RStudio, etc. setup _locally_, but how easy is it to get the same setup on a beefy AWS server?

---

## Other useful docker commands

```bash
# list running containers
docker ps

# stop a container
docker stop &lt;name&gt;

# start a stopped container
docker start &lt;name&gt;

# list runnning AND stopped containers
docker ps -a

# remove a stopped container
docker rm &lt;name&gt;

# list images currently on system
docker images

# remove an image
docker rmi &lt;image-name&gt;  # can't remove unless all related containers are removed
```

---

## Adding our own stuff

For a recent client deliverable, we used that [`rocker/tidyverse`](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned/blob/master/tidyverse/3.4.2/Dockerfile) image as a _base_, and added our own code to it by writing our own _Dockerfile_:

--

```Dockerfile
FROM rocker/tidyverse:3.4.2

USER rstudio

WORKDIR /home/rstudio

COPY clientpackage ./clientpackage/
COPY holdout-files ./holdout-files/
COPY models ./models/
COPY predict-script.R README.Rmd report/report.Rmd ./

RUN R -e "devtools::install('clientpackage', dependencies = TRUE)"

USER root
```

--

Then we setup Gitlab's CI tools so every time the code updates, Gitlab will build the image for us!

---

## Adding our own stuff

--
Last time we did a bunch of modeling for a certain client, we were using the R package `h2o`, which requires Java to run.
--
 I made a [small Dockerfile](https://github.com/MethodsConsultants/tidyverse-h2o/blob/master/Dockerfile) to add that on top of the `rocker/tidyverse` image:

```Dockerfile
FROM rocker/tidyverse:latest

RUN apt-get update -qq \
  &amp;&amp; apt-get -y --no-install-recommends install \
    default-jdk \
    default-jre \
  &amp;&amp; R CMD javareconf \
  &amp;&amp; install2.r --error \
    --repos 'http://cran.rstudio.com' \
    h2o
```

--

Because this is public on our Github, I [configured Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/methodsconsultants/tidyverse-h2o/) to automatically re-build the image anytime the Dockerfile _or the base image_ changes
--
, _for free_!

--

Then anyone connected to the internet can use this as easily as we used `rocker/tidyverse`:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:8787 methodsconsultants/tidyverse-h2o
```

---

## Adding stuff outside the Dockerfile

--

When doing research inside a container, we might not want to write our own Dockerfile that copies our code and/or data into the image

--

We instead use the `-v` option of `docker run` to make files on our computer available to the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:8787 -v ~/someproject:/home/rstudio/someproject rocker/tidyverse
```

--

Then if you add/delete/edit those files from within docker, the changes will happen on the host filesystem

--

For this specific image, t's important to attach our local volume to the home of user `rstudio` since that's the only user available by default

--

We could use environment variables to make a different user and/or set a password (again, image-specific)

---

## Things we didn't have time for

--
- networking

--

- environment variables

--

- why the layered approach is so awesome

--

- how to combine with CI tools

--

- pulling images from non-Docker Hub locations (e.g. private Gitlab registries)

--

- using `docker machine` to make docker hosts for us

--

- combining Docker with Packrat

--

- _orchestrating_ containers with Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, AWS ECS

---

## Parting thoughts

--
- Getting your Dockerfile right can take more work up-front, but is often worth the time saved down the line
--
 -- especially when combined with CI tools
    
--

- If you figure out how to install something _once_, you don't have to sweat it again

--

- Having code that runs _here_ but not _there_ is so last decade

--

- **Docker gives you portability _now_ and reproducibility _later_.**
